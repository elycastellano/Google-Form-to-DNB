Small bug in Google Forms

Vulnerability of Google Forms

The form is being sent to the client already with the answers. (see images)

In some cases teachers use the final space to show the answers, in this **specific** case the final space can be found before the test is submitted
This is a real problem, for example, for academic surveys it's necessary that the answers are hidden before the test is finalized. 

You can see the answer in plain text in viewform file on the source of the page. In any case (embed or stand alone) or (Test form with points or not)the answer is already there.
